# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Player Portal application needs to be properly configured for Vercel deployment with all API calls routed through Vercel serverless functions instead of local clients. Additionally, all menu items should be visible and working properly in the production environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to deploy successfully to Vercel, so that it can be accessed in production without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to Vercel THEN all build processes SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN the application loads in production THEN all environment variables SHALL be properly configured
3. WHEN the application runs in production THEN all dependencies SHALL be available and properly resolved

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all API calls to work in production, so that the application functions correctly without relying on local development servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application makes API calls THEN they SHALL be routed through Vercel serverless functions
2. WHEN the base44 client is used THEN it SHALL proxy requests through `/api/base44` endpoint
3. WHEN Firebase authentication is used THEN it SHALL work with production Firebase configuration
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN appropriate error handling SHALL be displayed to users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a parent user, I want the "Switch to O7C Hub" button to work correctly in production, so that I can navigate between applications seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a parent user clicks "Switch to O7C Hub" THEN they SHALL be redirected to the correct production URL
2. WHEN the application is in development mode THEN the localhost URL SHALL be used
3. WHEN the application is in production THEN the production URL SHALL be used

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all menu items to be visible and functional, so that I can navigate through all features of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN all navigation menu items SHALL be visible
2. WHEN a user clicks on any menu item THEN the corresponding page SHALL load without errors
3. WHEN a parent user accesses the application THEN they SHALL see the "My Players" menu item
4. WHEN a player user accesses the application THEN they SHALL see the standard player menu items

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for missing API endpoints, so that the application gracefully handles API failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API endpoint is not available THEN the application SHALL display appropriate error messages
2. WHEN Firebase is not configured THEN the application SHALL fall back to development mode gracefully
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN users SHALL see informative error messages
4. WHEN the application cannot connect to external services THEN it SHALL continue to function with limited features
